Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
The process of software development using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures to solve real life problems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Scope:    Software Engineering, Covers the entire software development lifecycle while traditional Programming focuses mainly on coding.
Methodology: Software Engineering Uses formal methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) while traditional programming often involves ad-hoc approaches.
Collaboration: Software Engineering emphasizes teamwork among cross-functional teams while traditional programming involves individual or minimal collaboration.
Quality Assurance: Software Engineering incorporates rigorous testing and validation processes while traditional Programming uses less formal testing procedures.
Documentation: Software Engineering requires comprehensive documentation, in traditional programming, documentation is often limited to code comments.
Project Management:Software Engineering includes structured project management practices, traditional programming relies on individual task management.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
SDLC is a descriptive and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. The phases are:
Feasibility study - Determines whether the developed product would be financially and technically feasible.
Requirements analysis and specification: - identify and understand the exact requirements of the customer and to document them properly. 
Design - This phase derives the software architect from the software requirement specification (SRS) document 
Coding and testing -Translates the software design into source code, which is then implemented as a program module. Each module is then tested in isolation and debugged.
Deployment and system testing - Different modules making up a software product are integrated to form a software. System testing is then done to ensure that the developed system conforms to specified requirements.
Maintenance - Involves correcting remaining errors, updating and adaptive maintenance for portability.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile:
Methodology: Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation.
Process: Divides work into Sprints, typically lasting one to four weeks.
Prioritizes delivering value to the customer/user quickly and frequently. Self-organizing teams allocate resources based on business priorities and use cases. Collaboration: Promotes ongoing collaboration.
Preferred Scenarios: Dynamic, evolving projects, when requirements are likely to change, customer-centric development.
Waterfall: 
Methodology: Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Process: Well-defined stages with formal hand-offs. Requirements for each step completed before moving to the next. Linear process from requirements to final release. Planning: Focuses on thorough planning and execution.
Preferred Scenarios: Stable, well-understood projects. When requirements are stable and unlikely to change. Projects with clear, predefined scope.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering involves defining, documenting, and maintaining the software as per the user’s needs and expectations.
Process:
1.  Elicitation: Involves collecting requirements from stakeholders using various methods such as interviews and surveys.
2.  Analysis: Analyse the collected requirements for errors.
3.  Specification: Documentation of the requirements in a concise manner.
4.  Validation: This phase ensures that the documented requirements align with the stakeholders’ needs and expectations.
5.  Management: Involves updating the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Python software design principles are often encapsulated in the SOLID principles. These principles aim to make software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Here’s a brief overview:
1.  Single Responsibility Principle - States that a class should have only one responsibility.
2.  Open-Closed Principle - software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
3.  Liskov Substitution Principle - States that if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use any of its subclasses without the program knowing or behaving incorrectly.
4.  Interface Segregation Principle – States that a class should not have to implement methods it doesn’t use.
5.  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing focuses on individual units or components of a software system. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software works as intended and meets the requirements. Example: Testing a single function in a program to ensure it returns the correct output for a given input.
Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. It focuses on determining the correctness of the interface. Example: Testing the interaction between two modules in a program to ensure they work together correctly.
System testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users. Example: Testing a complete software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is suitable for delivery to the end users.
Acceptance testing: Acceptance testing is a type of software testing that determines whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and whether it is ready for delivery to the end-users. Example: Testing a software system to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for delivery to the end-users.
The reason why testing is important is because it helps to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and is free from errors. Testing helps to improve the quality of the software, increases customer satisfaction, and reduces the risk of delivering low-quality software.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are software tools that help developers manage changes to code, collaborate with others, and maintain a record of modifications made to the codebase over time
Importance:
1.  Track changes: VCSs keep a record of every change made to the code, allowing developers to identify who made changes, when, and why. 
2.  Collaborate: VCSs enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, reducing conflicts and errors.
3.  Roll back: VCSs allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong. Popular version control systems include:
4.  Git: A distributed VCS that allows developers to work on local copies of the codebase and push changes to a central repository. Features include branching, merging, and pull requests.
5.  SVN (Subversion): A centralized VCS that uses a client-server model. Features include versioning, branching, and merging.
6.  Mercurial: A distributed VCS that allows developers to work on local copies of the codebase and push changes to a central repository. Features include branching, merging, and pull requests.
7.  Perforce: A commercial VCS that uses a client-server model. Features include versioning, branching, and merging.
